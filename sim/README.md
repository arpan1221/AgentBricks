# Synthetic Simulation Engine

This module contains the synthetic agent simulation engine that generates realistic user behaviors and interactions for training recommendation systems.

## Overview

The simulation engine creates millions of synthetic users (agents) with realistic preferences and behaviors, generates items (movies) with rich metadata, and simulates interactions between agents and items.

## Components

- **agents/**: Synthetic user agents with preference vectors and behavior patterns
- **items/**: Synthetic items (movies) with metadata and features
- **interactions/**: Interaction generation between agents and items

## Usage

_TBD: Add usage examples and documentation_

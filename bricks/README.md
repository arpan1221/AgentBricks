# Reusable System Components (Bricks)

This directory contains reusable system components that can be assembled to build production-grade ML recommendation systems.

## Available Bricks

- **ingestion/**: Data collection and event streaming
- **features/**: Feature engineering and feature store
- **training/**: Model training and model registry
- **serving/**: Low-latency recommendation serving
- **monitoring/**: Observability, metrics, and alerting
- **orchestration/**: Pipeline automation and scheduling

## Usage

Each brick is a self-contained module that can be used independently or combined with others to build complete systems.

_TBD: Add usage examples and documentation_
